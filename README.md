# Binomial Option Pricing Model using Risk Neutral Probabilites

A simple Binomial Option Pricing Model using the ipywidgets library I made to help study for an Investments Exam

This script will price a contingent claim using risk neutral probabilities, typically a call or a put. 

Inputs: Underlying price of a security, a strike price, and a high and low future price of the underlying
Outputs: Derivative Price, risk neutral probability (pi), Delta, and Bond Leverage (B)

While this script only uses one node of a tree to price an option, this underlying process forms the basis of risk neutral probabilities, a fundamental concept in derivative pricing used in the Black Shoels Equation and more.
